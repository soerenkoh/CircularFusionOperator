## Circular Fusion Operator for High Level Fusion

This code is part of the publication:

S. Kohnert and R. Stolle, "A High-Level Track Fusion Scheme for Circular Quantities," 2021 20th International Conference on Advanced Robotics. 2021, to be published.

### Abstract:
As sensors get more and more integrated, signalprocessing functions, 
like tracking, are performed closer to the sensor. Consequently, high level 
fusion is on the rise. Presented here is a high level fusion scheme incorporating 
not only linear, but circular quantities as well. Monte Carlo experiments areused 
to verify our novel fusion operators that work as aweighted average for 
the Wrapped Normal and the von-Mises distribution.
